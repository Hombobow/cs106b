Hi Dhruv,

This is Jacky Law, one of your many sectionees for the year of 2025.
I just wanted to let you know that I had such a great time learning from you this quarter.
I loved how inclusive you were of everyone and how you would encourage us by emphasizing that there were no bad questions.
You made our CS section something I looked forward to every week!

Best,
Jacky Law
